# Real-Time Face Mask Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

## How to Run
1. Open the `real_time_face_mask_detection_using_cnn_.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells.
3. Allow camera access to see real-time mask detection.

## Results
- The model can detect masked vs unmasked faces.
